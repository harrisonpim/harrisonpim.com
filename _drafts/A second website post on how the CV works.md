title: "Creating an always-readable CV"
excerpt: YAML, Jekyll, JSON, markdown,
---

- LaTeX is bad
- I want a version of my CV which I can update and extend easily
- readable in raw form, online, and printable as a pdf

- jekyll lets you import data
- example with one little file, code block
- example with a set of files in a subdirectory, disadvantage is that it's no longer a single, easily editable/readable file

- using magic nested list behaviour
