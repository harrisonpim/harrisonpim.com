I thought I'd start this new foray into blogging with a few posts on dead but interesting projects, like Bookworm; an old project which I never took the time to write up outside of a few [talks](/talks) and the project's github repo.

I read [Infinite Jest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_Jest) in 2016 - it's a really long book with hundreds of characters, interwoven plotlines and timelines, footnotes within footnotes within footnotes, and loads of tennis.

I love it, but it's not always easy to interpret David Foster Wallace's mad use of language or keep track of who's where when. As a result, people have put together [wikis](https://infinitejest.wallacewiki.com/) and infographics to help people make sense of the chaos. I found [this one](http://sampottsinc.com/ij/) by Sam Potts particularly helpful and interesting.

I love a bit of graph theory and network analysis, and I often find myself modelling things at work as graphs.
