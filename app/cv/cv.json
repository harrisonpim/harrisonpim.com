    "description": "I'm a data scientist / machine learning engineer with a background in computational / quantum physics. I write loads of python and typescript, and a little bit of everything else.\nI like working on hard R&D problems involving computer vision, natural language processing, graph theory, representation learning, recommendation systems, and information retrieval.\nI love turning those research projects into end-to-end pipelines and services which help people in the real world.",
